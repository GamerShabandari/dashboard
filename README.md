# Dashboard

Had the opportunity and responsibility to build this from the ground up by myself for Livsmedelsverket during my internship in the spring of 2023. This replaced their previous system that was built using Blazor. 
This version of the system uses dummy data for demonstrative purposes, repo is private due to security reasons
