# Dashboard 2.0

Had the opportunity and responsibility to build this from the ground up by myself for Livsmedelsverket during my internship in the spring of 2023. This replaced their previous system that was built using Blazor. 
This version of the system uses dummy data and allways displays the same tabledata for demonstrative purposes, all API fetch logic has been replaced with simple logic to display local data (real version uses Axios to handle all API logic).
